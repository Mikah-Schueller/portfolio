# Goods Page

### Description
The **Goods Page** is a feature from a larger project, showcasing a page where users can search for goods, auctions, and giveaways. While some functionality, like database connections, is currently not hooked up, the page includes key elements like a search bar, filters, and a price slider for refining results. This project is part of a term project for the semester.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for specific items in the database.
- **Filters**: Users can filter items by categories (e.g., goods, auctions, giveaways) to narrow down search results.
- **Price Range Slider**: A dual-range price slider adapted from [Codz Sword's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujncLU2bt4k) to filter results based on a specified price range.
- **Dynamic Display**: Items would normally be displayed based on search and filter criteria if connected to the database.

2. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The page uses standard web technologies for layout and interactivity.
3. **Database (Optional)**: The goods data would typically be fetched from a database, though it's currently not hooked up.
