## Projects Overview

### 1. Automated Tee Time Booker
**Summary**: A Python script designed to automate booking tee times at a local golf course. With tee slots filling up within seconds, this tool leverages Selenium and ntplib for precision, ensuring users secure their desired slot faster than any human can.

**Skills & Tools**:
- **Python**, **Selenium**, and **ntplib** for automation and precise timing.
- Features like customizable booking details and executable packaging for universal use.
- A real-world problem-solving tool designed to maximize efficiency.

### 2. Flappy Bird AI
**Summary**: My first foray into artificial intelligence. This project adapts a PyTorch-based AI tutorial to play a custom Flappy Bird game that I built using Pygame. The AI trains itself to improve over time, and growth is visualized using Matplotlib.

**Skills & Tools**:
- **PyTorch** for reinforcement learning.
- **Pygame** for game development.
- **Matplotlib** for charting AI performance and growth.

### 3. RPI Marketplace - Goods Page
**Summary**: A term project for a web application featuring a goods page. The page includes a search bar, filters, and a price slider adapted from a tutorial, allowing users to browse goods, auctions, and giveaways. While the database is currently disconnected, the design and functionality highlight my frontend and UX design skills.

**Skills & Tools**:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** for the frontend.
- Adaptation of a dual-range slider for price filtering.
- Focused on usability and adaptability for dynamic data.

### 4. Robot Code (Charged Up FRC Competition)
**Summary**: The codebase for my high school robotics team’s robot for the **FRC competition "Charged Up"**. I developed this by adapting previous years’ code while implementing new functionalities such as running an intake, autonomous routines, limelight distance detection, a PID-based auto-balancing system, and gear shifting. I also wrote a **sustainability guide** for future coders in the club.

**Skills & Tools**:
- Programming Talon FX motors and control loops.
- Implementing autonomous movement, distance detection, and gear control.
- Leadership and mentorship through technical documentation.
